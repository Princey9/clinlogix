# ClinLogix

ClinLogix is a lightweight command-line tool written in Rust for analyzing health-IT style log files. It helps users quickly identify errors and warnings in large, noisy logs generated by clinical and digital health systems.

This project was developed as part of a Digital Business coursework and demonstrates both a technical CLI tool and a simple product distribution approach.

## Problem

Healthcare and health-IT systems such as EHR services, HL7/FHIR interfaces, and backend services generate large log files. Manually scanning these logs is time-consuming and error-prone, and important issues can easily be missed.

## Solution

ClinLogix reads a log file and:
- Counts total log lines
- Detects and summarizes errors and warnings
- Allows filtering to show only error lines
- Provides optional JSON output for automation or further processing

The tool is designed to be simple, fast, and easy to integrate into developer or health-IT workflows.

## Features

- Rust-based command-line application  
- Clear summary of errors and warnings  
- `--errors-only` mode for quick triage  
- `--json` output for automation and pipelines  
- Distributed as a downloadable binary via GitHub Releases  

## Installation

You can either build ClinLogix from source or download a pre-built binary.

### Build from source (recommended for macOS users)

Clone the repository and build the project using Cargo:

git clone https://github.com/Princey9/clinlogix.git  
cd clinlogix  
cargo build --release  
../target/release/clinlogix --help  

### Download pre-built binary

A pre-built binary is available from GitHub Releases:

https://github.com/Princey9/clinlogix/releases/latest

macOS note: ClinLogix is an unsigned command-line tool. After downloading, run it from Terminal:

chmod +x clinlogix-macos  
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine clinlogix-macos  
./clinlogix-macos --help  

## Usage

Analyze a log file:

clinlogix demo-healthit.log  

Show only error lines:

clinlogix demo-healthit.log --errors-only  

Output summary as JSON:

clinlogix demo-healthit.log --json  

## Example Output

ClinLogix Report  
----------------  
File: demo-healthit.log  
Total lines: 6  
Errors: 2  
Warnings: 1  

## Target Users

- Health informatics students  
- Hospital IT and clinical systems support teams  
- Digital health and backend developers  

## Business Perspective

ClinLogix demonstrates how a small technical tool can be packaged and distributed as a digital product. The project combines a command-line application, a product website hosted on GitHub Pages, binary distribution via GitHub Releases, and a Lean Canvas describing the business model.
